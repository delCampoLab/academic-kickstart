I graduated in Marine Sciences from the University of Barcelona (UB). During my third year at university, I interned at the Marine Sciences Institute (CSIC), where I created a database for sea urchins and analysed the impact of marine heatwaves on their population in the Mediterranean. In my final year, I worked on a collaborative scholarship at the Department of Earth and Ocean Dynamics at the UB's Faculty of Earth Sciences, where I completed my thesis. For my thesis, I produced a Habitat Suitability Map of the Garraf seabed using data from multibeam echosounders, ROV images, and sediment samples collected with a Van Veen grab. Currently, I am employed in the same department at UB, working on the Ocean Citizen project, focused on restoring a gorgonian community in northern Tarragona. Alongside this, I am pursuing a Master's in Bioinformatics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), conducting an internship and completing my final thesis at the del Campo Microbial Ecology and Evolution Lab of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC). In this role, I will be studying the genomes of gorgonians and their symbionts.
