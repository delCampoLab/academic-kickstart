## The Institute of Evolutionary Biology seeks a PhD student

The [Institute de Biologia Evolutiva (IBE)](https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/) is a joint Institute of the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/en) and [Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/), located in Barcelona. IBE’s research is focused on the processes and mechanisms that generate biodiversity and on understanding the genetic basis of evolution. The IBE is part of the [Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB)](https://www.prbb.org/), a stimulating international research environment with state-of-the-art facilities.

### The Microbial Ecology and Evolution Lab
Our research at the Microbial Ecology and Evolution Lab (delcampolab.com) focuses on animal symbionts and the impact of global warming on the microbiomes of benthic marine animals. We employ wet and dry lab techniques, including experiments and bioinformatics analysis, to achieve broad research goals. We have developed methods to study the protists communities of animals, overcoming previous limitations for the incorporation of protists into microbiome studies. Also, we use single-cell approaches to explore the ecological interactions and evolutionary histories of hosts and their microbial symbionts. Our work also investigates the effects of ocean warming on the microbiomes of benthic marine animals, focusing on corals, to understand how environmental changes impact the composition and function of this symbiosis.

### Project description
Corals face threats from ocean acidification and heat waves due to the climate crisis. Coral reefs and coralligenous habitats are biodiversity hotspots that provide ecosystem services and coastal protection. Losing corals would severely impact biodiversity and coastal communities' livelihoods. The coral holobiont, consisting of corals and their microbiome, influences the host's evolution, physiology, and ecological functions. While zooxanthellae (Symbiodiniaceae) are well-studied, the role of other protists has been neglected. Protists contribute significant hidden genomic diversity in microbial habitats, including coral holobionts. Ignoring this diversity limits our understanding of protists' functions in corals and their impact on resilience to climate change. Our preliminary data reveal three times more coral protist symbiont diversity than previously reported, and that their community composition can predict coral responses to heat stress. The CORALPROS project aims to describe the morphological and genomic diversity of protists in the coral holobiont and map their distribution using advanced techniques. Including protists in coral holobiont studies will transform our understanding of host-microbe interactions, impacting our knowledge of coral responses to climate change.

### Specific Tasks

*	Collection of coral samples
