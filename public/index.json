The stramenopiles branch with the alveolates, rhizarians, and telonemids, forming the supergroup TSAR. Here, we present a new genus and species of aquatic nanoflagellated stramenopile: Mediocremonas mediterraneus, a free‐swimming heterotrophic predator. M. mediterraneus cell bodies measure between 2.0‐4.0 μm in length and 1.2‐3.7 μm in width, possessing two flagella and an oval body morphology. The growth and grazing rate of M. mediterraneus in batch cultures ranges from 0.68 to 1.83 d‐1 and 1.99 to 5.38 bacteria h‐1, respectively. M. mediterraneus was found to be 93.9% phylogenetically similar with Developayella elegans and 94.7% with Develorapax marinus, two members within the class Developea. The phylogenetic position of the Developea and the ability of M. mediterraneus to remain in culture makes it a good candidate for further genomic studies that could help us to better understand phagotropy in marine systems as well as the transition from heterotrophy to phototrophy within the stramenopiles.","tags":null,"title":"Mediocremonas mediterraneus, a New Member within the Developea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Patrick J.

However, there is growing evidence that microeukaryotes living on and in larger organisms (e.g. plants, animals, macroalgae) are diverse and in many cases abundant. We present here a new combination of ‘anti-metazoan’ primers: 574*f–UNonMet_DB that amplify a wide diversity of microeukaryotes including some groups that are difficult to amplify using other primer combinations. While many groups of microeukaryotic parasites are recognised, myriad other microeukaryotes are associated with hosts as previously unknown parasites (often genetically divergent so difficult to amplify using standard PCR primers), opportunistic parasites, commensals, and other ecto- and endo-symbionts, across the ‘symbiotic continuum'. These fulfil a wide range of roles from pathogenesis to mutually beneficial symbioses, but mostly their roles are unknown and likely fall somewhere along this spectrum, with the potential to switch the nature of their interactions with the host under different conditions. The composition and dynamics of host-associated microbial communities are also increasingly recognised as important moderators of host health.

The corals that build these structures are able to do so by forming intimate symbioses with dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae that provide photosynthetically fixed carbon to the coral host as an energy source. However, when ocean temperatures increase (particularly during marine heatwaves that are becoming more intense due to climate change), this symbiosis breaks down, the algae are expelled, and corals lose their coloration, a phenomenon popularly known as bleaching. As a result of bleaching, corals can quickly suffer mass mortality, destabilizing the entire reef ecosystem and threatening its survival. After decades of research on bleaching, our understanding of the genomic basis for bleaching, for both corals, their algal symbionts, and other partners (i.e., the coral holobiont) remains very limited. What is missing is a granular understanding of the genomics of bleaching linked to the functional changes that occur during the process. To fill this knowledge gap, we need to comprehensively characterize the transcriptomic response of the coral holobiont at the single-cell level in order to capture the functional genomic response of the different members of the coral holobiont during bleaching events. Not doing so limits our understanding of the bleaching process and consequently our ability to develop strategies to improve the survival trajectories of coral reefs in the current climate crisis. Our goal is to develop an approach that can be used to scrutinize the transcriptomic response of the coral holobiont at the single-cell level. Our central hypothesis is that not all coral and symbiont cell types have the same transcriptomic profile. Therefore, they will not have the same response to bleaching. We formulated this hypothesis based on the available single-cell transcriptomic data from basal animals related to corals that show different transcriptomic profiles indifferent cell lines and based on the few transcriptomic studies on coral symbiotic algae and bacteria. Our rationale is that having an integrated granular understanding of the coral holobiont’s transcriptomic response across coral cell types and symbionts during a bleaching event will transform our understanding of coral bleaching and potentially help us identify better strategies for intervention (NASEM 2019).\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"433a88a23797ea359644067987582451","permalink":"https://delcampolab.github.io/project/singlecell/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/singlecell/","section":"project","summary":"Using single-cell transcriptomics to understand the heat stress response of reef coral holobionts.","tags":["microbiome","corals","singlecell","transcriptomics"],"title":"A transcriptomic cell-atlas of reef coral bleaching","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Calcium carbonate production in the ocean is dominated by planktonic microeukaryotes such as coccolithophores and foraminifera (Feely et al 2004. Science 305: 362–66). However, an alternative and remarkable carbon sink in the ocean has been greatly overlooked, that is piscine carbonate. Marine teleost fish precipitate CaCO3 in their intestines as part of their osmoregulatory strategy. Based on the estimate that marine fish biomass is around 800-2,000 million tons, this carbonate precipitation by fish can represent up to 15% of the total calcium carbonate deposition in the ocean (Wilson et al 2009. Science 323: 359–62). More recent ocean fish biomass estimates are 10 times higher (Irigoien et al. 2014. Nat Com 5: 3271), so this percentage could be even higher. Oceanic acidification due to elevated atmospheric CO2 is predicted to have major impacts on calcifying organisms, decreasing the CaCO3 production rates in calcifying marine plankton and corals as ambient CO2 increases (Orr et al 2005. Nature 437: 681–86). On the other hand, the production of carbonate precipitates by fish will accelerate as a result of both increasing seawater temperatures and CO2 concentrations. Biomineralization mechanisms in plankton and corals depend on the seawater concentrations of CO2 or HCO3 which change with pH as CO2 concentration increases (Wilson et al 2009). Fish, in contrast, use endogenous CO2 to produce HCO3 ions that rise to very high concentrations within the gut lumen. Thus, the contribution of fish to marine carbonate production will putatively increase in the future and become an even more important component of the inorganic carbon cycle (Heuer et al 2016. Sci Rep 6: 1–8). Despite carbonate precipitation being critical for fish rehydration and survival and having captured the attention of fish biologists for decades, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this reaction are still unknown. Strikingly, no candidate genes putatively involved in this process have been identified so far when analyzing the genome and the transcriptome of the Gulf Toadfish, the model organisms used to study this process. The impossibility to identify these genetic mechanisms within the fish genome lead us to consider the hypothesis that it is gut microbiota responsible for the carbonate precipitation. The involvement of bacteria in calcium carbonate deposition in marine environments is a well-known phenomenon that has been linked to photosynthesis, sulfate reduction, the nitrogen cycle, and saltern environments (Hammes et al 2002. Rev Env Sci Bio 1: 3–7). So, the carbon precipitate capabilities of bacteria are proven in the free-living environment. As well, bacteria have been linked in mammals to the development of kidney stones (Schwaderer et al 2017. Ann Trans Med 5: 3–8). There are different types of kidney stones, being the most common ones composed of calcium oxalate crystals (CaC2O4). It has been observed that bacteria are capable of producing calcium coated shells or calcium derived metabolic byproducts that would act as crystallization centers for the formation of renal calculi (Kose et al 2018. Sci Rep 8: 1–13). The lack of genomic clues in the fish genome and the proven capability of bacteria to precipitate carbonates outside and inside animal hosts makes a compelling case to test the hypothesis that members of the fish microbiome are responsible for piscine carbonate deposition. Considering the significant contribution of piscine carbonates to the global ocean carbon budget, it is of paramount importance to determine the genomic mechanisms involved in this process. A full understanding of the microbial role on piscine carbonate deposition will help to improve carbon dynamics modeling and to design alternative carbon sequestration and ocean acidification mitigation strategies.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"a48c3259a55108acc4610c39f367dfce","permalink":"https://delcampolab.github.io/project/toadfish/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/toadfish/","section":"project","summary":"The microbiome of the Gulf Toadfish (Opsanus beta) and its role in osmoregulation.","tags":["microbiome","fish","transcriptomics"],"title":"Biomineralization in the Toadfish microbiome","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Corals, specifically scleractinians from tropical regions are declining at alarming rates due to global climate change induced ocean warming and acidification. Corals, like other animals, contain rich microbiota found within various anatomical compartments (i.e. surface mucopolysaccharide layer, epidermal polyp tissue, gastrovascular cavity, and skeletal CaCO3 matrix) that are heavily dependent on surrounding environmental conditions. The community of microbes in association with the host, defined as the “microbiome”, is a conglomeration of eukaryotic (fungi and protists, such as endolithic microalgae), prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) microorganisms, and viruses. The microbiome and the host together make up the “holobiont”, a term that encompasses the intricate relationships and interactions between host-microbe, and microbe-microbe within the coral ecosphere. The microbial communities present among the anatomy of a coral are composed of commensal, long-term, stable partners that co-evolve with the coral host and short-term, more variable taxa that may or may not serve functionality within the holobiont. Upon severe shifts in environmental conditions (i.e. climate change induced sea surface temperature increases), opportunistic alien pathogens may proliferate within the coral holobiont leading to disease and/or death. In addition to alien pathogens proliferating upon environmental shifts, long-term or passively adhering opportunistic microbes, that under stable environmental parameters are neutral holobiont members, become pathogenic - a term coined “dysbiosis”. This relatively recent hypothesis has the potential to restructure how we look at disease and develop methods to identify pathogens. Despite the first disease being described in 1973, to date there are no definitive causative agents responsible for coral disease. To complicate matters, the misidentification of coral diseases places the number of disease types to remain unknown as well. The reason is primarily due to the variation in how diseases affect different coral species, leading to multiple classifications for diseases that may have the same causative agents (etiology). There is a clear knowledge gap in our understanding of coral disease etiology, which happens to be the best information to effectively manage coral disease outbreaks (e.g. scleratinian coral tissue loss disease) worldwide. The demand for a reproducible, sensitive, and effective method of pathogen identification in the field of coral microbiology is apparent, however the field of human pathology uses a combination of culture-based techniques, imaging, and next generation sequencing of nucleic acids. Therefore, if a defined workflow could be produced, the process of disease identification would be not only advanced, but also accessible to other researchers, aiding in coral disease management and mitigation globally.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"84166eb09cae6270d9d2745ae81d8f5f","permalink":"https://delcampolab.github.io/project/disease/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/disease/","section":"project","summary":"A systems biology approach to the study of reef corals infectious diseases.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Koch at the reef - Understanding coral disease","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The PR2 database was initiated in 2010 in the frame of the BioMarks project from work that had developed in the previous ten years in the Plankton Group of the Station Biologique of Roscoff.

UPF) is focused on the study of host-associated microbes and the effect of global warming on the microbiomes of benthic and planktonic marine animals. We have a wet and dry lab, to perform experiments and bioinformatics analysis, enabling the broadest possible goals.\n  The eukaryotic microbiome. Unlike the study of the bacterial fraction of the microbiome, the study of the micro-eukaryotes associated with animals has largely been restricted to visual identification or molecular targeting of particular groups. The application of high-throughput sequencing approaches, such as those used to look at bacteria, has been limited because the barcode gene we use to study microeukaryotes ecology and distribution in the environment, the 18S rRNA gene, is also present in the host animals. As a result, when host-associated microbial eukaryotes are analyzed the retrieved sequences are dominated by the host. Stemming from my work on coral-associated microeukaryotes, we successfully implemented an approach that avoids the amplification of metazoan host genes, which allows us to use high throughput methods to study the microeukaryotic communities of animals. This approach opens the door to the study of diversity and distribution of microeukaryotes in a myriad of environments, from the coral surface to the human gut.\n  Effects of ocean warming on the microbiomes of benthic and planktonic marine animals. Ongoing climate change and its effects on the environment, such as rising sea temperature, has strong impacts on free-living marine microbial communities. However, the effects of global warming have not been properly studied on host-associated microbiomes. Microbiomes (both prokaryotic and eukaryotic) associated with host organisms have a strong influence on host evolution, physiology, and ecological functions. We study how environmental changes resulting from global warming affect the composition and function of the microbiomes in key members of the marine fauna and consequently how these changes affect the hosts. Currently, our study focuses on these impacts on corals, teleost fish, and zooplankton. To tackle this novel research topic, we use a combination of molecular biology, ecophysiology, and bioinformatics.\n  These are some of our current projects:\n A transcriptomic cell-atlas of reef coral bleaching Biomineralization in the Toadfish microbiome Koch at the reef - Understanding coral disease The microbiome-brain axis in the California sea hare PR2 database. A reference 18S rRNA sequence database  We are always open to new projects and ideas, so stayed tuned for updates and opportunities.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"503186d53154e48f0f52abb02c00dfac","permalink":"https://delcampolab.github.io/page/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/page/research/","section":"page","summary":"The research we do.","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Friends and collaborators  Bass Lab.
